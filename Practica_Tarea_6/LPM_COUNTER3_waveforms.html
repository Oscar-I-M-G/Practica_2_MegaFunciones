<h2><CENTER>Sample behavioral waveforms for design file "LPM_COUNTER3.vhd" </CENTER></h2>
<P>The following waveforms show the behavior of lpm_counter megafunction for the chosen set of parameters in design "LPM_COUNTER3.vhd". The design "LPM_COUNTER3.vhd" is a 4 bit dynamically controlled up/down modulus 6 counter. The counter supports an asynchronous load of data input. The counter has an asynchronous clear input. </P>

<P><FONT size=3>The behavior of the cin input is identical to the behavior of the cnt_en input. The output port cout will be asserted at the completion of count sequence. The ports cin and cout are used to chain multiple counters together. </P>
